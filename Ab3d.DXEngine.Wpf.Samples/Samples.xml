Each instance can be rendered with its own color and its own transformation matrix (defines instance position, scale and rotation). Instancing greatly improves performance because there is very little CPU overhead when rendering objects (only one draw call for all instances).\n\bNOTE:\b This sample is using PresentationType set to DirectXOverlay. This can greatly improve performance of rendering instancing because graphic card can render in the background. With DirectXImage, the CPU needs to wait until graphics card finishes rendering and then can send the rendered image to the WPF composition engine. A drawback of DirectXOverlay is that no WPF object can be drawn over 3D scene."/>

  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/ShadowRenderingSample.xaml" Title="Shadow rendering" Description="The standard shadow rendering in Ab3d.DXEngine is provided with the \bVarianceShadowRenderingProvider\b. It uses a variance shadow mapping algorithm that can render nice soft shadows with minimal artifacts (compared to some other shadow rendering techniques). The shadows can be rendered to all 3D objects.\nIn this algorithm, the whole 3D scene is rendered from the light's position into a special texture - a shadow map. The values in this texture do not represent object colors but float values that represent distances from the light. Because the shadow information for the whole 3D scene (not only for visible part) is written into one texture, the resolution of the shadow depends on the size of the shadow texture and the size of the 3D scene. Sometimes it is desirable to have a more blurry shadow. But other times, especially in technical applications, users want to have more precise shadows. To increase the shadow resolution, the shadow texture size needs to be increased (with ShadowMapSize property), or the size of the whole 3D scene needs to be decreased. For example, if your 3D objects are only a fraction of the size of a big plane, then the resolution would be significantly improved when the plane's size is reduced.\nVarianceShadowRenderingProvider supports shadow from directional and spot lights. Point lights are not supported."/>
  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/PlanarShadows.xaml" Title="Planar shadows" Description="Planar shadow rendering is the second shadow rendering technique in Ab3d.DXEngine. It is provided by PlanarShadowRenderingProvider and can render shadow to a 3D plane. Its advantage over VarianceShadowRenderingProvider is that it can render sharp shadows that do not loose precision even when user zoom into the shadow. It is also much faster to render. The shadows are rendered with applying a shadow matrix to all objects. This matrix flatten all the objects so that they have no height and become only a 2D shape of the object's shadow. That shape is then rendered a 3D object on top of the plane.\nTo support clipping to plane's bounds by the GPU (when using Ab3d.PowerToys this need to be done in software) and to prevent rendering some parts of the shadow multiple times, a DirectX stencil buffer is used.\nDisadvantages of PlanarShadowRenderingProvider are that it can render shadows only to a 3D plane, it cannot render soft shadows, shadows are rendered for object behind the plane or point light, some objects that lie on the plane or are very close to the plane may get slightly invalid shadow.\nIt is also possible to render planar shadows without PlanarShadowRenderingProvider and with using only PlanarShadowMeshCreator from Ab3d.PowerToys but this does not provide hardware accelerated shadows rendering (shadow object need to be created on the CPU) and cannot render transparent shadows correctly."/>

  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/LineDepthBiasSample.xaml" Title="Line depth bias" Description="Line depth bias sample shows how to use depth bias to offset the depth of the lines. This can prevent drawing the 3D line and solid object at the same depth which causes z-fighting (lines appear disconnected because sometimes they are on top of solid object and sometimes they are inside the solid object).\nThe samples on the left show that the correct bias value needs to be defined based on the size of the objects (see comments in code for more info)."/>

Description=""/>
  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/LinesWithPatternSample.xaml" Title="Lines with pattern" Description="This sample shows how to render lines with patterns.\r\n\bLinePattern\b is an int value that defines the 16 bit int value that defines the line pattern - if bit is 1 then line is drawn, when 0 line is not drawn. Note that the lowest bit is rendered first so the patten value needs to be read from right to left. For example, line with pattern 0xF0F0 will starts with empty part (4 empty bits) and then 4 full parts will be rendered.\r\n\bLinePatternScale\b is a float value that sets the pattern scale factor. Value 1 does not scale the pattern. Values bigger then 1 increase the pattern length; values smaller then 1 decrease the pattern length (making it more dense).\r\n\bLinePatternOffset\b is a float value that sets a pattern offset. This value is usually between 0 and 1 - 0 value means no offset, 1 means offset for the whole patter which is the same as no offset. Value 0.1 means that the line will begin with the pattern advanced by 10%, 1/16 means that the pattern is offset by one bit.\r\n\r\n\bLimitations:\b\r\nLine pattern is not supported on polylines, other connected lines and lines with arrows. To render line patterns on polylines, you will need to convert them to MultiLineVisual3D or other disconnected line type."/>
  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/ColoredPolyLinesSample.xaml" Title="Colored poly-lines" Description="This sample shows how to render lines with different start and end colors.\n\nBoth multi-line and poly-line use the same positions and colors array. The difference is that with multi-lines the lines are not connected and each line is defined by two positions. With poly-lines the lines are connected and one line's end position is the start positions of the next line."/>
  <Sample Page="DXEngineVisuals/TransparencySortingSample.xaml" Title="Transparency sorting" IsNew="True" Description="This sample is showing different options to sort transparent objects (see 'Transparency problem' sample in Ab3d.PowerToys sample for more info why transparency sorting is needed).\n1) When \bno transparency sorting\b is used, then some objects are not visible through other objects.\n2) Using \bTransparencySorter from Ab3d.PowerToys\b sorts the objects in Model3DGroup so that Children collection first defines those that are farther away from the camera. This method works correctly but is not the fastest. First sorting WPF objects takes some time and also because the order of objects is changed, the Update part of the Ab3d.DXEngine rendering pipeline takes much more time. Also, it would be almost impossible to sort objects from different ModelVisual3D or Model3DGroup objects.\n3) Using \bsorting from Ab3d.DXEngine\b is much more efficient then using TransparencySorter. It sorts the objects inside the DXScene.TransparentRenderingQueue. Sorting is highly optimized and also does not require additional work in the Update phase.\n\bBy default transparency sorting is disabled. To enable it set DXScene.IsTransparencySortingEnabled property to true.\b To adjust the sorted order, you can use the DXScene.TransparentRenderingQueue.SortingCompleted event.\n\nWith Ab3d.DXEngine it is also possible to render transparent objects without sorting with using advanced techniques like \balpha-clipping\b and \balpha-to-coverage\b.

Also, it can be used to hit test SceneNode objects that are not created from WPF objects (for example MeshSceneNode objects).\n\nNote that when 3D lines are rendered with hardware acceleration, then they cannot be used in the standard hit testing. The reason is that in this case no triangles exist on the main CPU memory that can be hit tested. In case of line with arrow, it is created on the CPU and therefore it can be hit tested."/>

Description="MeshOctTree is a data structure that organizes the triangles in 3D space into multiple levels of MeshOctTreeNode objects so that the search of a triangle or a check for triangle ray intersection is very efficient. Each MeshOctTreeNodes divide its space into 8 child MeshOctTreeNodes.\n\nMeshOctTrees are used in DXEngine for very efficient hit testing of complex MeshGeometry3D objects\nFor example, when a standard hit testing is used on a 3D mesh, then the ray needs to be tested for intersection with each triangle in the mesh. Because meshes can have many triangles this can take a lot of time. When MeshOctTree are used, then first the MeshOctTree nodes that intersect the ray are found and then only the triangles in those nodes are checked for intersection with the ray. This massively decreases the number of required intersection tests."/>
  <Sample Page="DXEngineHitTesting/InstancedObjectsHitTesting.xaml" Title="Instanced hit testing" Description="This sample shows hit testing on instanced objects.\nTo make WPF hit testing (used by EventsManager3D) work, you need to set IsWpfHitTestVisible property to true.
