        // NOTES related to rendering many lights in Ab3d.DXEngine
        //
        // Ab3d.DXEngine can render ambient light and 16 other lights (Directional, Point and Spot lights) in one rendering pass
        // (maximum number of lights is defined in the following constant Ab3d.DirectX.Shaders.SuperShader.MaxLights).
        // When more lights are defined in the scene, the lights are rendered with multiple rendering passes.
        // For example this sample is rendered with 4 rendering passes (8 * 8 = 64 lights; 64 / 16 = 4 passes).
        // This means that the scene is first rendered with ambient light and first 16 lights.
        // Then all the scene objects are rendered again with the next 16 lights.
        // The pixel colors that are rendered this time are added to the pixels that were rendered in the previous pass (this is additive blending).
        // Then the next pass is rendered until all lights are used.
        //
        // This works well for most of the cases.
        // But additive blending also have some limitations:
        // 1) When multiple lights overlap the colors can become overburned (too white).
        //    This can happen because each pass just adds the colors to the previous color.
        //    For example if one object has Diffuse color set to (255, 150, 0) and is fully illuminated by two lights in two different rendering passes,
        //    the final color will be (255 + 255, 150 + 150, 0 + 0) = (255, 250, 0) which will be too bright (green = 255 instead of 150).
        // 
        //    One way to prevent that is to use only 16 lights (remove the lights that are far away or have minimal effect on the scene).
        //    You can also use the FilterLightsFunction property on RenderObjectsRenderingStep (you can get it from DXScene.RenderingSteps collection) -
        //    the FilterLightsFunction can dynamically remove the lights that are not valid for the current scene (this is more efficient than adding and removing the lights from the scene).
        // 
        //    Another way to prevented this is with manually arranging the lights so that the lights that overlay (shine on the same area) are rendered in the same
        //    rendering step (remember that 16 lights are rendered in one step). To do this you might need to add some dummy lights (PointLight with almost black color and radius 1).
        //
        //    It is also possible to increase the number of lights rendered in one rendering pass.
        //    To do this you will need to purchase the source code for the effects and shaders. Then please contact me and I will instruct you on how to
        //    change and compile the shader to accept more then 16 lights and render them in one rendering pass.
        //
        //
        // 2) Semi-transparent objects may not be rendered correctly.
        //    The problem is that multipass rendering required additive blending where pixel colors from rendering passes are added to the previous pixel color.
        //    But rendering transparent pixels require alpha blending where the final pixel color is determined by the alpha value of the pixel.
        //    Those two modes cannot be used at the same time so in some cases the transparent objects are not rendered correctly.
        //
        //
        // It is also possible to disable multi-pass rendering with setting the AllowMultipassRendering property to false.
        // The property is defined on RenderObjectsRenderingStep (you can get it from DXScene.RenderingSteps collection).
