[Ab3d.DXEngine](https://www.ab4d.com/DXEngine.aspx) is a DirectX 11 rendering engine for Desktop .Net applications. Ab3d.DXEngine is built for advanced business and scientific 3D visualization.

Ab3d.DXEngine uses **super fast rendering** techniques that can fully utilize graphics cards and provide the **ultimate performance**. It also supports **top quality visuals** with PBR materials and shadows.

The samples in this repository demonstrate many features of the engine and show that with .Net it is easily possible to create applications with complex 3D graphics.

The samples are using [Ab3d.PowerToys](https://www.ab4d.com/PowerToys.aspx) library - the ultimate WPF and WinForms 3D toolkit library that greatly simplifies developing desktop applications with scientific, technical, CAD or other 3D graphics.

Both Ab3d.DXEngine and Ab3d.PowerToys are commercial libraries. You can start a 60-day trial when they are first used.
